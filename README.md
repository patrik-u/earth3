# earth3

![showcase](https://github.com/patrik-u/earth3/blob/main/docs/images/showcase.jpg)

earth3 is a react component for real-time rendering of earth using react-three-fiber (three.js renderer for react). We are going for a semi-realistic high-res and visually stunning rendering to be used for data visualization, games and any projects where you want to be able to display and explore the earth.

This is currently just project stub with a simple rendering. We are welcoming people who are interested in contributing to the project.
